Hi, I’m Melanie Montgomery (@montgomery9)

I’m a data and financial analyst with a background in global business and over 10 years of experience in financial operations, reporting, and process improvement. I’m currently deepening my technical skills in SQL, Python, and Power BI, and working on hands-on projects to strengthen my portfolio.

I’m open to collaborating on analytics, reporting, or operational efficiency projects, especially those involving SAP, Excel, or BI tools.
